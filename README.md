graylog2-mongo-es-migrator
==========================

A small migration script to copy graylog2 messages from
MongoDB to ElasticSearch.

Usage
-----

After you've downloaded the script you should edit the configuration
file in `config/migrator.yml`.
If the ElasticSearch and MongoDB servers are running on the same
system (on `localhost`) and MongoDB doesn't need authentication you can
keep the file as is.

To download all required dependencies you need to install them by running
Bundler with:

    bundle install


After that you can start the migration by running:

    ruby migrator.rb
